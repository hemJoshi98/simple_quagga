# Barcode-scanner

Delete the node_module folder and install the following package:

    $ npm i quagga

This application can be integrated with node but for the purpose of this demo I have not done so.

You can run the prpgram by just opening the index.html in your browser -> Click "Start/Stop the scanner" -> Scan a barcode with code_128 formatting.

We can later enhance the program to read multiple barcode formatting if needed.
